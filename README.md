# Pizza Hut Restaurant Management System (DBMS Project)

A simple database-driven Restaurant Management System built as part of a DBMS course project.  
This system uses MySQL for data storage and XAMPP for running the database locally.

## 📌 Overview

This application helps simulate core restaurant operations such as taking and recording orders, managing customer bills, and tracking inventory using a structured relational database.

## 🧩 Features

- Manage and record customer orders
- Track menu items and prices
- Store and update inventory details
- Use structured MySQL database operations (CRUD)

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Database:** MySQL  
- **Local Server:** XAMPP  
- **Tools:** phpMyAdmin (for database management)  
- **Languages:** SQL (queries), basic scripting

## 🗂️ Project Structure

Inside the `pizzahutms` directory:

pizzahutms/
├── SQL files (e.g., table creation)

## 🚀 How to Run (Locally)

1. Install **XAMPP** (if not installed).  
2. Start **Apache** and **MySQL** modules.  
3. Open **phpMyAdmin** ( http://localhost/phpmyadmin ).  
4. Create a new database (e.g., `pizzahutms_db`).  
5. Import the provided `.sql` files (table structure + sample data).  
6. Use your SQL client or phpMyAdmin to run queries.

## 📌 Example Usage

- Use phpMyAdmin to view tables: customers, orders, menu_items, etc.
- Run SQL commands to insert/update orders or inventory.
- Use the system as a data manager for test scenarios.
